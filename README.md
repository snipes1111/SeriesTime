# SeriesTime
Test project
Hello there!ðŸ‘‹
Represent my training project. Unfortunatly, because the lack of time I didn't finished it yet, but I'll try) 
The main idea is to track your progress in watching TV-Series. Building this app I used MVC framework as an architectural pattern.
Realized features:
1) compositionall layout;
2) animation transitions to detail screen;
3) custom banners, buttons, cells and headers;
4) tracking your watching progress (via UserDefaults) and etc.
Have some plans to realize:
1) work with network in order to add new series from the open source API ( for ex. Open Movie Database (OMDb) API, or IMDb API). Alamofire welcome);
2) implement adding function and search bar to interract with database;
3) add a progressView to track progress of watching series;
4) implement local data storage using core data or realm and more...

In short, there is still a lot of work to be done))
